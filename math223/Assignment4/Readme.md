# Assignment 4
In this assignment we were tasked to find and solve a number of recurrences, using the method of
characteristic equations, particular solutions and generating functions. I do not have the answers here,
but I used python to continuously double-check the results I was getting.

## Question 1
This was a simple homogenous recurrence, so I just used the method of characteristic equations.
I wrote a recursive function to define the recurrence, and a regular math equation for the equivalent
mathematical function.

Usage of q1.py:

```bash
% python q1.py

```

Since I'm getting all 0's it means the function I got was correct.
