Moorie Machine Translation
--------------------------
A Moore state-machine task has three major components viz,  a state table,
an initial state and the actions associated with a synchronous reset.

The state table details state transitions and outputs. The task starts

The tags below show the syntax used to capture these three components.

moore_Begin

moore_Reset(Action(s))   

moore_TableBegin(Initial_State) 
moore_TableRow(Current_State, Action(s), Next_State)
...
moore_TableRow(Current_State, Action(s), Next_State)
moore_TableEnd

moore_End

Note 1: A file containing a Moore state-machine task must have extension
.moore and exist in the Fsm directory.

Note 2: The moore_Reset tag is required even if there are no actions
associated with the task.
