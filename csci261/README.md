# CSCI 261 - Computer Architectures and Assembly Language
A tough but surprisingly fun class. This folder is a bit of a mess, but it is an example of the assembly language and low-level structures we worked with using:
- the SSBC system 
   - a machine which has only been described and virtualized
   - turing complete, but incredibly restrictive design. Uses not much more than a dozen opcodes
- m68HC11 assembly code
- Perl modules for the DATAQ system
