gen.pl generates Makefiles for all the listed modules with the exception
of the main Makefile and the Exc Makefile.  Warning, it overwrites
existing makefiles. Also, note that when tb.cew does not exist in a
directory, the template tb.cew is copied from Cew/Template. This tb.cew
is only a stub and has no test cases and no errors :)
