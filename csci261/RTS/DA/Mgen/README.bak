gen.pl generated Makefiles for all the modules in inet with
the exception of the main Makefile and the Exc Makefile.
Warning, it overwrites existing makefiles. Also, note
that when tb.cew does not exist in a directory, the template tb.cew
is copied from Cew/Template. This tb.cew is only a stubb and has no
test cases and no errors :)
